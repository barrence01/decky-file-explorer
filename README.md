Let's you access your Steam Deck files from anywhere


Steam stores screenshots by default in a hidden directory separated by game.
But you can change the default directory to a more accessible one.

You need to go to: `Steam > Settings > in-game` and there should have an option to store to a specific folder.

For videos, you'd need to change it in `Steam > Settings > game recording`, but the actual video file won't be playable until you assemble the files on steam panel.
I have added a feature in the hamburguer button to simplify this process, there you will have options to assemble the video and give it a name, but it may use some CPU from your Steam Deck.
